	<p> While New York has eased pandemic restrictions, the restaurant industry is still a long way to recovery. Many eateries have shut down permanently, while others have struggled to regain their pre-pandemic customer base. Supply chain bottlenecks and inflation create additional financial pressures on an already-battered industry.

	Below, we cover some of the issues facing restaurant owners in the post-COVID economy. </p>

	<p> Consumer prices have increased rapidly throughout the economy. For restaurants, wholesale food costs have increased wildly. The prices of some ingredients have increased by over 100% in 2022.  </p>

	<p>New York City lost 55,000 jobs in the Accommodations and Food Services Industry, according to a report by the Comptrollerâ€™s office. The relative shortage of experienced servers and chefs means that restaurants have to pay higher wages for less experienced employees.  </p>

	<p> Many restaurants exhausted their savings and credit to survive during the pandemic, leaving them with fewer resources to invest now that the pandemic is over. In a survey of restaurant owners by <em>TouchBistro</em>, 59% said they used their personal savings to keep their business afloat. </p>
